# moleculerjs-cluster-microservices
This project consists of demonstrating an simple implementation of the microservices architecture using the MoleculerJS microframework. Two services (Books and Shop Carts) were implemented with their respective responsibilities and databases, just for demonstration purposes. In addition, there is also the node responsible for the API Gateway layer, Service Discovery, Tracing, Logging, etc. Service management takes place through docker containers.
